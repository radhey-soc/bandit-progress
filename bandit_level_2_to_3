Bandit Level 2 → Level 3
Level Goal says:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory
1. Logged in as bandit2 using SSH:
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
2. landed in home directory after login, verified the file using ls.
3. read the file using the command:
cat ./"--spaces in this filename--"
 If the path wasn't double quoted, the shell would treat, spaces, in, this, filename as separate arguments due to word splitting 
5.  The output was the password for bandit3.
